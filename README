# How to set up
To run the application, download the repository, extract it, go to the folder containing docker-compose.yml and run docker-compose up -d.
```
docker-compose up -d
```
For simplicity, all ports were hardcoded.

# How to use
To get the data to the database, use the POST-endpoint "http://<ip-of-docker-host>:5000/projects", with the data.json content as body (application/json). I recommend to use an HTTP-Client like Insomnia, Postman or curl.

To view the frontend, go to "http://<ip-of-docker-host>:1870".
To view the backend SwaggerAPI, go to "http://<ip-of-docker-host>:5000/swagger/index.html"
To communicate the backend, make requests to "http://<ip-of-docker-host>:5000/project/{id}" with the corresponding body's.
